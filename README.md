We welcome contributions!  An easy way to contribute is to click the 'Open in IDE' button above. This will open the TKPJavaSrc repo in a customized Codenvy factory and facilitate your suggested updates by allowing you to code, build and run and also to make a pull request from within the Codenvy environment.  We have a short document which describes our approach to course ware design as well.  It is here -- https://www.penflip.com/lynnlangit/tkp-lesson-plans/blob/master/course100.txt

This is the TKPJava API source repository - here we've implemented a Logo-like library, which includes Objects such as a Turtle, Tortoise and many more.  We've also created documentation and examples specifically designed to be fun for kids ages 10-14 to learn to code.  We welcome feedback, suggestions and pull requests!  

The 'teaching repo' is found in a companion repo - https://github.com/TeachingKidsProgramming/TeachingKidsProgramming.Java
That repo contains a starter set (.jar) of .java files for teachers to use with students when teaching TKPJava.  It also contains a set of customizations for Eclipse that are specifically designed to make the coding experience more fun for beginners.
