TKP Source for Java
===================================
This is the TKPJava API source repository. Here we've implemented a Logo-like library, which includes objects such as a Turtle, Tortoise and many more.  We've also created documentation and examples specifically designed to be fun for kids ages 10-14 to learn to code.  We welcome feedback, suggestions and pull requests!  

An easy way to contribute is to click the 'Open in IDE' button below. This will open the our repo in a customized Codenvy factory (web-based IDE). It's designed to facilitate your suggested updates by allowing you to code, build, run and also to make a pull request all from within the Codenvy environment.

We have a short document which describes our approach to courseware design as well.  It is here -- https://www.penflip.com/lynnlangit/tkp-lesson-plans/blob/master/course100.txt

The TKPJava 'teaching repo' is found in a companion location - https://github.com/TeachingKidsProgramming/TeachingKidsProgramming.Java
That repo contains a starter set (.jar) of .java files for teachers to use with students when teaching TKPJava.  It also contains a set of customizations for Eclipse that are specifically designed to make the coding experience more fun for beginners.
