TKP Source for Java
===================================

This is the TKPJava API source repository - here we've implemented a logo-like library, which includes Objects such as a Turtle, Tortoise and many more.  We've also created documeentation and examples specifically designed to be fun for kids ages 10-14 to learn to code.  We welcome feedback, suggestions and pull requests!

The 'teaching repo' is found a companion repo - https://github.com/TeachingKidsProgramming/TeachingKidsProgramming.Java
That repo contains a starter set of .java files for teachers to use with students when teaching TKPJava.
