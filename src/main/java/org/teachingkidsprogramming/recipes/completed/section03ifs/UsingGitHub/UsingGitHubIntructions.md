# Getting Started with GitHub



1. Each students will eventually use his/her own computer, but to start log in on the shared computer for the pair of students.  (Partner A's computer) with <yourSchool> (_admin_) account. This is required to be use GitHub
2. On your local computer, open GitHub Desktop and then open the '_teachingkidsprogramming_' _Repo_. 
3. Using _Chrome_, go to GitHub.com for Partner A.
4. On your local computer, using GitHub Desktop, check to make sure no changes have been made and therefore no commits are necessary.  If commits are needed, then go ahead and do that.
5. Now, as a pair, complete the coding for 'HiLowQuiz' (for a grade) on the shared _laptop_.
     TIP: Early finishers, continue coding (start the 'ChooseYourOwnAdventure' recipe).
6. When everyone is done, go back to GitHub Desktop application and see the dot next to 'Changes' that changes have been made. Commit.  Name commit "HiLow Quiz". Sync to the remote _tkp_ _repo_.
7. Verify on Partner A's GitHub.com that new code has been _synced_ in the cloud for the HiLowQuiz.java file This means that all English comments have now been translated into Java.
8. Close shared _laptop_. Open Partner B's _laptop_. Have Partner B login to GitHub.com and search for Partner A's account in GitHub.com. 
9.  Once you find it, fork Partner A's _tkp_ _repo_ by clicking the 'fork' icon on the upper right of the GitHub.com site for the TKP _Repo_.


*NOTE: Download and install the free GitHub Desktop application BEFORE teaching this lesson. Do this on EACH student's _laptop_.*
